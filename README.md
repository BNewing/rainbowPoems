# Rainbow Poems

This is a project that I wrote for fun. There are two parts to it; the first is choosing a poem to be printed on the screen, and the second is clicking a button that makes colours of the rainbow cascade down the lines of the poem.

Marten at Zooniverse showed me functional programming and helped me write the JavaScript for this project.
